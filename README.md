# trident

This is the code I used for an LED trident prop I built for our local production
of Disney's The Little Mermaid.

It was created for an [Adafruit Pro Trinket
5V](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2000) using [DotStar
LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/885), several
[buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/235), and pressure sensors made
with [Velostat conductive material](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1361).

## Editing

It's recommended that you use VS Code for editing. VS Code provides a number of
extensions for completing and inspecting code, and Microsoft is working on an
extension to fully integrate the Arduino build experience. To use it:

- Install the [Arduino Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-arduino)
- [Configure Intellisense](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54510703)
